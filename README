The go.mobile repository holds libraries and build tools for Go on Android.

This is early stage work. The build system integration is not ready.
For now,

1. Install Android Studio.
2. Install the Android NDK.
3. Pick a home for the standalone NDK toolchain and set an environment variable:
	NDK_ROOT=$HOME/android/ndk-toolchain
4. Confiure the NDK toolchain:
	ndk/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh \
		--platform=android-9 --install-dir=$NDK_ROOT
5. Create an android App in studio, then set
	ANDROID_APP=$HOME/android/studio/yourapp/app

With these two environment variables, the make.bash script in
go.mobile/example/hello_jni builds a .so file and symlinks in
the necessary java files to the project.
